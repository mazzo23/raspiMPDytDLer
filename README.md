# Installation of raspiMPDytDLer:

this guide assumes you already have a clean raspbian with all nessesary network stuff configured  and ready to go. 
here is where we start.
Basic install routine for all Linux distros(i guess).

#  essentials

**mpd**  
*The Daemon*

**ffmpeg**  
*for video and audio conversion*

**youtube-dl**  
*for downloading youtube videos and other streams*

**mpc**  
*to control the Daemon*

**ncmpcpp**  
*Commandline player... next lvl control of the Daemon*

**Rompr**  
*Webinterface... ultimativ control of the Daemon*  

**tilda**  
*nice terminal that works well together with ncmpcpp (for client only, no use on raspi)*
